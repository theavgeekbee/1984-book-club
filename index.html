          <h2>Deep Dive No. 1</h2>
          <p>Ted Talk, presented by Peter Seo. Written by Kian Kanan and Peter Seo.</p>
          <hr style="border: 1px solid white">
          <h2>Transcript:</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is Katherine of the lower party, and I am here to talk about the glory of our dear leader and comrade B.B that leads us to victory and better lives for the people.</p>
          <p>You might know of the Anti-Sex League, where the preaching coming from that organization is developing young minds and the youths of today to cut inefficient energy in their lives and to have purpose in our lives!</p>
          <p>I used to be married for quite some time, and I would like to digress on my experience for the first part.</p>
          <p>I married a nice young man working at the Ministry of Truth in the lower party, that is.</p>
          <p>I was always subservient to him; when we were making a baby for the party, I always reminded him every weekend to bear my fertility and become a productive member of the Party, doing what I can to serve my great state.</p>
          <p>It’s impossible seeing what is going on with the world now. We have people using unnecessary energy for pleasure of the flesh when we could be using that to greater things, such as the intermittent production value in our factories, our warzone, or even a few more letters on the speakwrite. 
          <p>No, we don’t do any of that, because Goldstein secretly has infected us to be counterproductive and counter-revolutionary, and the reactionary minds are poisoning us and our values.</p>
          <p>Every single two minutes of our day we have, I take the anger out on the single enemy of the-the barbarous measles that took our beloved state into nothing but their target, to kill us and murder us and horrible things to us, even molding thought into our minds.</p>

                <h3>What is the role and purpose of religion in a totalitarian secular society, and how does it conflict with the government?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Religion is hated by the Party as it goes against the Party's values (examples: hate week, anti-sex league, artificial insemination and the taboo on sex).</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Connections:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A key part of religion is justice and standing up against evil for the greater good of society which contrast’s the parties ideologies which is self-serving  for its own good over the good of Oceania itself.</li>
                      <li>These advocations can be found through the Baha'i faith</li>
                      <li>"<u>Man is he who forgets his own interests for the sake of others. His own comfort he forfeits for the well-being of all. Nay, rather, his own life must be willing to forfeit for the life of mankind.</u>" (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Foundations of World Unity, p. 42)</li>
                      <li>"<u>By the exercise of his free will, man either affirms his spiritual purpose in life or chooses to perpetuate evil by living below his highest station. The question is asked: 'Is such a behaviour to be attributed to God, or to their proper selves?' And concludes: Every good thing is of God, and every evil thing is from yourselves.</u>" (The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 663)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The advocating for human rights, conscious freedom, education, and a moral society is a threat to the Party.</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The Party aims to create a naive society who are confined of individual freedoms, creating a hyper-reliant society that can be controlled with ease.</li>
                      <li><strong>Linguistic Alteration (Newspeak):</strong>&nbsp;This allows the Party to eliminate words associated with rebellion, simplifying words to inhibits critical thinking.</li>
                      <li><strong>The Thought Police:</strong>&nbsp;Neutralizes rebellions by criminalizing even thinking about liberty.</li>
                      <li><strong>Literature (Ministry Of Truth):</strong>&nbsp;With all forms of literature being altered and some destroyed by the Ministry Of Truth, which creates citizens who cannot educate themselves on the information necessary to move beyond the party and rebel.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>In modern day you find many similarities between the Party and current or potential future candidates for this. Such as the U.S with a history of governmental controversy  and unfit leaders whose pursuit of their role is merely for the gain and leaving citizens to suffer for their selfish actions.  This ties back to how religion provides morality, giving the parallel of totalitarianism and secularism to religious values who generally create  more thriving communities with countering actions to Oceania.</li>
                  <li>In the book it references many fascist, dictator, or communist concepts or people. For example the black mustachioed man is most likely a reference to the infamous Adolf Hitler. In the book it's shown that the children of Oceania are eager and prepared to serve the party just as the Nazi Youth were trained under Nazi ideologies to preserve and serve the state. Furthermore, the taboo on sex discourages reproduction for the love and humanity , but rather as a form of service to the Party. This implants the mindset of ideological preservation throughout their populace and allows them to pass these values down generationally. The mindset and ideologies oppose those of religion because many religions view the family unit as the cornerstone and most important aspect of society, while the party simply views reproduction as simply a job without any regard for what comes with it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Regardless of their origin, do all morals lead to justice, where do they come from and what is the responsibility of society to maintain justice and morals?</h3>
                <p>The origin of morals themselves is of human origin founded by humans being a form of self imposing rules to maintain structure and morality within society for the greater good of everyone. In regards to their integrity and impact, it is found to be subjective due to the varying values between humans one moral viewed as great could be seen as godless in the view of another person. It's the job of society to maintain these morals to preserve aspects of humanity.  In conjunction with their purpose is providing a response to morally,and ethical situations, through which we can conclude that morals train the human mind's judgement due to their complexity. This is a threat to the party as it creates citizens that have critical thinking and judgement.</p>
                <h5>Modern Day</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Abortion:</strong>&nbsp;People are split between this topic on a moral standpoint. The more religious side finds it morally inhumane as a life is being taken while the more liberal side aligning with modern day values see it as the women's right and is the women's choice.  Once again we find an interconnection between the more liberal and secular side opposing the religious side just as in 1984 religion is the party's moral enemy.</li>
                  <li><strong>Religious Morals vs Modern Morals:</strong>&nbsp;The job of morals are generally universal but their usage and expression vary from society and social climate. A more traditionalist society sees morals as how to maintain their sense of humanity and preserve traditional values. While in modern secular liberal societies morals are viewed more as rights or reasons to promote their ideologies.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Changes Across Time</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Shifts in Morals:</strong>&nbsp;We see nowadays that morals have changed with time and widespread communication. Firstly with access to social media, pop culture and globalization the most dominant countries imprint their mark on the others. For example we see that many morally controversial topics are taken to social media such as abortion, and border conflict on such widespread platforms people can preach their values and sheepishly people follow. While back then cultures didn’t intertwine, interracial marriage was frowned upon and social media was yet to exist so universal morals didn’t exist leading a more diverse enviroment for morals and ethics.</li>
                  <li><strong>Connections:</strong>&nbsp;The diversity of morals is opposite to what the party desires the wish to create a dogmatic society under a totalitarian rule. The Party necessitates towards a total loyal society under which it can have full control over the lives of the individuals in there, where  basic human empathy, whether in religious value or not, is but just one other necessary trait. Moral values like these are repressed of the populus to dissuade the people from banding together and sharing loved times, but only to be used as dispensable resources in society.</li>
