            <h2>Transcript:</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Katherine of the lower party, and I am here to talk about the glory of our dear leader and comrade B.B that leads us to victory and better lives for the people.</p>
            <p>You might know of the Anti-Sex League, where the preaching coming from that organization is developing young minds and the youths of today to cut inefficient energy in their lives and to have purpose in our lives!</p>
            <p>I used to be married for quite some time, and I would like to digress on my experience for the first part.</p>
            <p>I married a nice young man working at the Ministry of Truth in the lower party, that is.</p>
            <p>I was always subservient to him; when we were making a baby for the party, I always reminded him every weekend to bear my fertility and become a productive member of the Party, doing what I can to serve my great state.</p>
          <p>It’s impossible seeing what is going on with the world now. We have people using unnecessary energy for pleasure of the flesh when we could be using that to greater things, such as the intermittent production value in our factories, our warzone, or even a few more letters on the speakwrite. 
          <p>No, we don’t do any of that, because Goldstein secretly has infected us to be counterproductive and counter-revolutionary, and the reactionary minds are poisoning us and our values.</p>
          <p>Every single two minutes of our day we have, I take the anger out on the single enemy of the-the barbarous measles that took our beloved state into nothing but their target, to kill us and murder us and horrible things to us, even molding thought into our minds.</p>
